    <!--Long Instructions-->
    <string name="aboutText">"Many dogs are left at home alone for at least up to 8 – 10 hours a day. Many pay for one-on-one professional training sessions or come home and work on basic commands to train	your dog. SeeMeTrain training app allows you to train your pet while you are at	work or	out	of the home	for an extended	period of time during the day.\n\nProcedure: \n\u2022 Set the schedule and playlist information\n\u2022 Place the device in an area that the dog can hear and see the video, but not reach.\n\u2022 Keep the commands simple. Repeat the commands. Give the dog	praise (minus the treats).\n\u2022 When	making your	video, make it as natural sounding as possible. Allow for a few minutes to let the dog complete the command since you can’t see him/her do it.\n\u2022 Come home and test it out!\n\nDeveloped by Team Sapphire in Capstone Program from College of Computer Science and Engineering in Ohio State University\nTeam members: Joe Donnelly, Ramya Ravishankar, Soumyashree Gad and Zijiang Yang\nProfessor: Alan Cline\nIcons made by FlatIcon.com, FreePik.com and  http://www.iconsmind.com"</string>
    <string name="recordInstructions">\tTips:\n\nRecord yourself giving simple, clear commands to your dog.\nGive only one command per video.\nStart with an easy command like sit, stay or lie down.\nVideos are limited to 60 seconds. </string>
